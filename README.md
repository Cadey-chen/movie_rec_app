This movie recommender app aims to help users find a list of movies to watch for any mood, any occasion. Users can choose to briefly describe what kind of movie they are looking for and get a list of movies based on that description, or provide the name of a movie they love already, and get a list of similar movies to that movie, or browse the top picks from each genre by Ratings, Popularity, or the Bayesian Average of both. 

The deployed application can be found here: https://movierecapp.com/
